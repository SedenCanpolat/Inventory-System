# InventorySystem
 
This project is a Unity-based inventory system written in C#. It allows players to interact with objects, pick up and store items, and use them within the game. The system consists of:

Interactable System: Defines objects that the player can interact with.         
Interaction Mechanism: Uses raycasting to detect objects and handle interactions.        
Inventory Management: Adds, removes, and tracks items using a singleton-based inventory system.  
User Interface (UI): Displays inventory items and manages item selection.
